# ‚öôÔ∏è Component Language Pack - Remix Edition

> **üì¢ IMPORTANT:** This is a modified fork of the original [Component Language Pack by ExoAE](https://github.com/ExoAE/ScCompLangPack).
> **All credit for the original language pack goes to [ExoAE](https://github.com/ExoAE).**
> This remix was created using [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) to provide an alternative compact naming format.

## üéØ What's Different in This Remix?

This version uses a **compact naming format** that puts the important stats first:

**Original format:**
`XL-1` ‚Üí `XL-1 S2 Military A`

**Remix format:**
`XL-1` ‚Üí `M2A XL-1`

The format is: **[Type][Size][Quality] [Component Name]**

**Type abbreviations:**
- **M** = Military
- **I** = Industrial
- **C** = Civilian
- **R** = Racing (Competition renamed to avoid conflict with Civilian)
- **S** = Stealth

**More examples:**
- `QuadraCell MT` ‚Üí `M2A QuadraCell MT` (Military, Size 2, Quality A)
- `Eco-Flow` ‚Üí `I1B Eco-Flow` (Industrial, Size 1, Quality B)
- `Cryo-Star` ‚Üí `C1B Cryo-Star` (Civilian, Size 1, Quality B)
- `AbsoluteZero` ‚Üí `R2B AbsoluteZero` (Racing, Size 2, Quality B)
- `NightFall` ‚Üí `S2A NightFall` (Stealth, Size 2, Quality A)

This makes it easier to quickly scan and sort components by their stats at a glance!

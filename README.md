## üéØ What's Different in This Remix?

This version uses a **compact naming format** that puts the important stats first:

**Original format:**
`XL-1` ‚Üí `XL-1 S2 Military A`

**Remix format:**
`XL-1` ‚Üí `M2A XL-1`

The format is: **[Grade][Size][Quality] [Component Name]**

**Grade abbreviations:**
- **M** = Military
- **I** = Industrial
- **C** = Civilian
- **R** = Racing (Competition)
- **S** = Stealth

**More examples:**
- `QuadraCell MT` ‚Üí `M2A QuadraCell MT` (Military, Size 2, Grade A)
- `Eco-Flow` ‚Üí `I1B Eco-Flow` (Industrial, Size 1, Grade B)
- `Cryo-Star` ‚Üí `C1B Cryo-Star` (Civilian, Size 1, Grade B)
- `AbsoluteZero` ‚Üí `R2B AbsoluteZero` (Racing, Size 2, Grade B)
- `NightFall` ‚Üí `S2A NightFall` (Stealth, Size 2, Grade A)

This makes it easier to quickly scan and sort components by their stats at a glance!
